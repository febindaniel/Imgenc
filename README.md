# 🖼️ StegoCrypt – Secure Image Steganography App For File Hiding

StegoCrypt is a secure steganography application built using **Python** and **Flutter** that allows users to **hide encrypted files inside images** and retrieve them securely.

The project combines **cryptography and steganography** to ensure both **data confidentiality and concealment**, making it suitable for secure data transmission scenarios.

## ✨ Features

* 🔐 Encrypt files before embedding
* 🖼️ Hide files inside image files using steganography
* 📂 Supports multiple file types (PDF, TXT, ZIP, etc.)
* 🔓 Decrypt and extract hidden files from images
* 📱 Cross-platform interface built with Flutter

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python** – Core logic, encryption, steganography processing
* **Flutter** – Cross-platform UI
* **Cryptography libraries** – For file encryption & decryption
* **Image processing techniques**

## 🔐 How It Works (High Level)

1. User selects a file (PDF / TXT / ZIP, etc.)
2. File is **encrypted** using a secure encryption algorithm
3. Encrypted data is **embedded inside an image**
4. Image appears visually unchanged
5. For extraction, the image is processed and the file is **decrypted securely**
